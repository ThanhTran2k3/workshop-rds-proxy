Select Support Plan In the Select a support plan page, select an effective plan, to compare plans, see Compare AWS Support Plans. Wait for your account to be activated After selecting Support plan, the account is usually activated after a few minutes, but the process can take up to 24 hours. You will still be able to log in to your AWS account at this time, the AWS Home page may show a “Complete Sign Up” button during this time, even if you have completed all the steps in the registration section. After receiving an email confirming your account has been activated, you can access all AWS services. Important The following AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) actions will reach the end of standard support on July 2023: aws-portal:ModifyAccount and aws-portal:ViewAccount. See the Using fine-grained AWS Billing actions to replace these actions with fine-grained actions so you have access to AWS Billing, AWS Cost Management, and AWS accounts consoles.\nIf you created your AWS account or AWS Organizations Management account before March 6, 2023, the fine-grained actions will be effective starting July 2023. We recommend you to add the fine-grained actions, but not remove your existing permissions with aws-portal or purchase-orders prefixes.\nIf you created your AWS account or AWS Organizations Management account on or after March 6, 2023, the fine-grained actions are effective immediately.\nAWS assigns the following unique identifiers to each AWS account:\nAWS account ID: A 12-digit number, such as 012345678901, that uniquely identifies an AWS account. Many AWS resources include the account ID in their Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The account ID portion distinguishes resources in one account from the resources in another account. If you\u0026rsquo;re an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console using either the account ID or account alias. While account IDs, like any identifying information, should be used and shared carefully, they are not considered secret, sensitive, or confidential information.\nCanonical user ID: An alpha-numeric identifier, such as 79a59df900b949e55d96a1e698fbacedfd6e09d98eacf8f8d5218e7cd47ef2be, that is an obfuscated form of the AWS account ID. You can use this ID to identify an AWS account when granting cross-account access to buckets and objects using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). You can retrieve the canonical user ID for your AWS account as either the root user or an IAM user.\nYou must be authenticated with AWS to view these identifiers.\nWarning Do not provide your AWS credentials (including passwords and access keys) to a third party that needs your AWS account identifiers to share AWS resources with you. Doing so would give them the same access to the AWS account that you have.\n"

If you reopen your AWS account during the post-closure period (within 90 days after you close the account), you agree that the same agreement terms govern your access to and use of the service offerings through your reopened AWS account.\nAWS Management Console access Your access to the AWS Management Console for a closed AWS account is restricted. During the post-closure period, you can still sign in to your AWS account to view your past billing information and access AWS Support. You can\u0026rsquo;t access any other AWS services or start any new AWS services in the closed account.\nFind and terminate active resources To prevent unexpected charges, prior to closing your account, we recommended that you first review and terminate all applicable resources currently running in the account.\nLog in to the AWS Management Console. On the navigation pane, choose Services. On the Services page, search for Resource Groups. Under Tag Editor, in Regions, select the regions where you have created resources, or choose All regions. In Resource types, select All supported resource types. Choose Search Resources. If search results appear, then there are still active resources on the account. Note: AWS Resource Groups search results don\u0026rsquo;t show AWS Marketplace subscriptions. To manage subscriptions, see Managing your software.\nYou should archive your content and delete the resources where appropriate. For additional instructions on how to retrieve your content, see the documentation for that service.\nFor more information, see How do I check for active resources that I no longer need on my AWS account?\nExisting content and services still in use after closing After the post-closure period, AWS automatically deletes any remaining content in your AWS account, and attempts to terminate any AWS services that are still in use. For more information about the post-closure period, see Accessing your AWS account after you close it.\nYour payment method We charge you through your designated payment method for any usage fees incurred before you closed your AWS account. We issue you any refunds that might be due through that same payment method. If you have active subscriptions (such as a Reserved Instance that you pay for monthly), even after your account is closed, you might continue to be charged for the subscription through your designated payment method until the subscription expires or is sold according to the terms governing the subscription. These charges and refunds might occur after you close your account.\nIn addition, if you reopen your account, you might be charged for the cost of running AWS services (that you didn\u0026rsquo;t stop before closing your account) during the post-closure period. Closing your AWS account doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect payment methods that you use on Amazon.com or other Amazon websites.\nOn-Demand charges During the post-closure period, billing for On-Demand charges stops. However, you\u0026rsquo;re billed for any usage that has accrued up until the time you closed your account. You\u0026rsquo;ll be charged for that usage at the beginning of the next month. In addition, if you purchased any subscriptions with ongoing payment obligations, you might continue to be charged for them after your account is closed.\nImportant: You will continue to generate costs if you don\u0026rsquo;t stop or delete your resources.\nDomains registered with Amazon Route 53 Domains that are registered with Route 53 are not deleted automatically. When you close your AWS account, you have three options:\nYou can disable automatic renewal, and the domains are automatically deleted when the registration period expires. For more information, see Enabling or Disabling Automatic Renewal for a Domain.\nYou can transfer the domains to another AWS account. For more information, see Transferring a Domain to a Different AWS Account.\nYou can transfer the domains to another domain registrar. For more information, see Transferring a Domain from Route 53 to Another Registrar.\nIf you already closed the account, you can open a case with AWS Support to get help with disabling automatic renewal or transferring your domains. For more information, see Contacting AWS Support About Domain Registration Issues. There is no charge to open a case for domain registration issues.\nCharges if you reopen your AWS account If you reopen your AWS account during the post-closure period, you might be billed for the cost of any AWS services that aren\u0026rsquo;t stopped or resources that aren\u0026rsquo;t deleted before you close your account.\nExample: You reopen your AWS account 30 days after closure. Your AWS account had only an active t2.micro Amazon EC2 instance at closure. For this example, imagine that the price for a t2.micro Amazon EC2 instance in your AWS Region is $0.01 per hour. In this case, you might be charged for 30 days x 24 hours x $0.01 per hour = $7.20 for your AWS services.\nCross-account access to the account you’re closing After you close your AWS account, any access requests to your closed account\u0026rsquo;s AWS services from other AWS accounts fail. This occurs even if you have granted the other accounts permission to access your account\u0026rsquo;s AWS services. If you reopen your AWS account, other AWS accounts can again access your account\u0026rsquo;s AWS services and resources if you granted the necessary permissions to the other AWS accounts.\nRemoving Amazon VPC peering connection AWS doesn\u0026rsquo;t delete Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) peering connections when you close one of the accounts participating in the VPC peering connection. Any traffic destined for the VPC peering connection originating from other active accounts is dropped because AWS terminates instances and deletes any security groups in the closed account. To remove the VPC peering connection, delete it from your account using the Amazon VPC console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or Amazon EC2 API. For more information, see Deleting a VPC Peering Connection.\nTroubleshooting errors when closing an AWS account If you receive an error message while trying to close your AWS account, you can contact your account representative or contact AWS Support to open a billing or account support case for assistance. Common reasons why you might not be able to close your AWS account include the following:\nYour account is the management account of an organization in AWS Organizations with active member accounts. To close the management account, you must first remove all member accounts from the organization.\nYou have unpaid invoices for your account.\nYou are not signed in to the account as the AWS account root user.\nYou are an active AWS Marketplace seller.\nHow to Close Your AWS Account Minimum Permissions To perform the following steps, you must have at least the following IAM permissions:\nYou must sign in as the AWS account root user, which requires no additional IAM permissions. You can\u0026rsquo;t perform these steps as an IAM user or role. Review Considerations before Closing Your AWS Account Sign in as the root user of the account you want to close, using the email address and password associated with the account. Note that signing in as an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role will not allow you to close an account.\nOn the navigation bar in the upper-right corner, select your account name (or alias), and then choose \u0026ldquo;Account.\u0026rdquo;\nScroll to the end of the Account page to the \u0026ldquo;Close Account\u0026rdquo; section. Make sure you read and understand the text next to the check boxes. Once you close an AWS account, you will no longer have access to AWS services using that account.\nSelect the check boxes to accept the terms, and then choose \u0026ldquo;Close Account.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the confirmation box, choose \u0026ldquo;Close Account.\u0026rdquo;\nAccessing Your AWS Account after Closure After closing an AWS account, you will no longer have access to AWS services using that account. However, during the 90-day period following account closure (known as the Post-Closure Period), you can:\nView past billing information for your AWS account. Access AWS Support. During the Post-Closure Period, AWS may retain any content you didn\u0026rsquo;t delete and any active AWS services. To access remaining content or AWS services, you can reopen your account within the Post-Closure Period.\nReopening Your AWS Account To reopen your AWS account, contact AWS Support. If you choose to reopen your account, you can access retained content and AWS services that were active before account closure. Note that you might incur charges for running these AWS services during the Post-Closure Period. Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate these costs.\nAfter the Post-Closure Period Once the Post-Closure Period ends, AWS permanently closes your AWS account. Any undeleted content will be permanently deleted, and any active AWS services will be stopped. Service attributes necessary for billing and administration purposes may be retained.\nPlease note that you cannot create a new AWS account using the same alias or email address that was registered to your closed AWS account.\nHow to Close Your AWS Account Minimum Permissions To perform the following steps, you must have at least the following IAM permissions:\nYou must sign in as the AWS account root user, which requires no additional IAM permissions.

	"content": "Amazon Relational Database Service Proxy (Amazon RDS Proxy) Overview of Amazon RDS Proxy Amazon Relational Database Service Proxy (Amazon RDS Proxy) is a fully managed database proxy service for Amazon RDS that helps improve performance, increase availability, and enhance scalability for applications using Amazon RDS or Aurora.\nWhat is RDS Proxy? RDS Proxy acts as an intermediary layer between applications and Amazon RDS or Aurora. RDS Proxy manages connection pooling to reduce database connection overhead and reuses existing connections to optimize resources and improve application performance.\nKey Benefits Feature Benefits Connection Pooling Reduces new connections and saves resources Automatic failover Increases application availability Lambda/Container optimization Reduces cost and latency in serverless High security Supports IAM, TLS and Secrets Manager Reduces \u0026ldquo;too many connections\u0026rdquo; errors Prevents database connection limit exceeded Security Integration RDS Proxy supports:\nIAM authentication: No need to store username/password in applications TLS encryption: End-to-end encryption from application to database Secrets Manager: Secure storage and rotation of login credentials Suitable Use Cases Serverless applications (AWS Lambda) requiring fast connections Microservices with multiple instances accessing the same DB Reducing cost and latency when connecting to database frequently Systems requiring automatic recovery during failover How It Works Application connects to RDS Proxy endpoint instead of RDS endpoint RDS Proxy checks connection pool, reuses connection if available If not available, RDS Proxy opens new connection to RDS endpoint Manages connection lifecycle and automatic failover Important Notes RDS Proxy does not replace RDS or Aurora but serves as an intermediate connection layer. You need to enable IAM role for Lambda/EC2 to connect to proxy. Use with Multi-AZ RDS to increase availability for failover scenarios. RDS Proxy must be in the same VPC as RDS. If you are building a system that requires high availability and good performance when accessing databases, RDS Proxy is a service worth considering.\n"
